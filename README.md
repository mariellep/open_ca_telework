# The Open CA Telework Dashboard Project
In Spring 2024, the State of California Telework Dashboard was abruptly taken down. The Dashboard contained information that makes a strong case for telework.

This is an open source project intended to recover, revive, renew the initial dashboard or create an equivilent alternative. All interested parties are encouraged to contribute to this effort.
